# Helm starter

My proposal as a Helm chart starter scaffold to spin up your application.

> What is a [Helm starter](setup_starters.sh) anyway?

## Activate the starter packs

Run
```
./scripts/setup_starters.sh
```

## Use a starter pack

Run in the directory you want to have your new Helm chart:
```
helm create --starter my-app [YOUR-NEW-FABULUS-APP-NAME]
```
